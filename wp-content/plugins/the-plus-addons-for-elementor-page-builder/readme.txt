== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Does Elementor is required to use this plugin?**

Yes. You need to install & activate the Elementor plugin first to get access to The Plus Addons Widgets & Features.

**Elementor Panel in the editor is freezed and shows a spinning circle.**

Make sure your memory limit is set to 768M or higher, If you have multiple elementor addons installed and you are having an issue with the elementor panel loading icon and freeze.

Is the issue created due to The Plus Addons? No. This is not anyone‚Äôs bug/issue. It‚Äôs just because, If you want to use more widgets, Your server needs more memory limit to use everything in your backend.

My Hosting Provider doesn‚Äôt allow a higher memory limit, What to do? If that is the case, You just need to disable all unused widgets from The Plus Addons and all other addons you have installed. This will reduce the need for the required memory limit as the total number of active widgets will go down.

**Everything is messed up in Backend. Or Everything looks perfectly fine in the Backend but has issues on the frontend.**

Make sure you have removed cache from The Plus Settings ‚Üí Performance ‚Üí Purge all cache. Furthermore, remove cache from all your 3rd party cache plugins. Moreover, remove your browser cache by hard reload and/or test your site on incognito mode.

**Your Font Awesome Icons are not visible?**

You need to turn on compatibility for font awesome 4 from Elementor -> Extra Settings.

**My Backend Speed is down after installation of The Plus Addons.**

We do not load any extra files, which will reduce your backend performance. But, If you are having issues with loading in the Elementor panel with more delay, That means You need to increase your memory limit. If you can not increase the memory limit, You need to disable all unused widgets from The Plus Settings ->Plus Widget as well as from all other Addon plugins you have installed on your website.
